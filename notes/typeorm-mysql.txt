# Option 1

@fan123199 everything should still work if you use the mysql_native_password plugin.

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YourRootPassword';
-- or
CREATE USER 'foo'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'bar';

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


# Option 2

docker exec -it YOUR_CONTAINER mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '{your password}';
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '{your password}';
SELECT plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE User = 'root';
